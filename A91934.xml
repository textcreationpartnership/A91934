            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I took not my houſe at <hi>Lambeth</hi> to accommodate Families, but onely ſuch Priſoners, as by Order of the Council ſtand commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to me: and therefore whereas I hear you ſay, that Mr. <hi>Feak</hi> at <hi>Windſor</hi> hath his wife and children with him, and yet pays nothing; which is not altogether improbable, becauſe <hi>Windſor</hi>-Caſtle is the States proper houſe; but ſo is not Mine, nor the goods.

So wiſhing that you may be a partaker of Chriſt's ſufferings, rather than thoſe of Evil doers, I reſt,</p>

            <p>The truth is, The <hi>Goalers</hi> Children were ill of the <hi>Swine-Pox,</hi> whereby we and other Priſoners were in danger; but
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118847:11"/>bleſſed be the Lord, not one of ours; and the <hi>Child</hi> we ſent away <hi>one night,</hi> for fear he ſhould catch it in the houſe, the next <hi>day</hi> we had him home again to the <hi>Priſon</hi> (for we had not, nor have we any other earthly home but a <hi>Priſon</hi> now, ſo that my <hi>family</hi> was forced to be with me, which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law of God and Nature) the Child being in <hi>good health,</hi> nor was there the leaſt ground to ſuſpect ſuch a <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> in my Family: but had it been ſo, the ſending of him away did not tend to indanger the <hi>Priſoners,</hi> but to keep them from it; nor needed he to ſay <hi>any longer,</hi> for that at no time were any in danger by any of my <hi>Family,</hi> (for the Diſeaſe was in the <hi>Goalers</hi> Family, who it may be might <hi>report</hi> it <hi>in mine,</hi> on purpoſe to bring all the <hi>vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> they could upon me, by incenſing their <hi>Maſter</hi> againſt me.)</p>
            <p>And indeed, the warning which he called <hi>civil,</hi> to ſend my <hi>Children</hi> from me, (and the Lord knows, I knew not whither) I could not ſee <hi>civil</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> and therefore reſted rather contented to have the <hi>Bedding</hi> pull'd from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me, and to lie in pads of <hi>Straw</hi> with my <hi>poor Children,</hi> than to be ſo mercileſs and unfatherly to them as he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.

            </p>
            <p>That day word was given before to the Governour of the <hi>Caſtle,</hi> and by Orders the Souldiers were ſet on both ſides, with their <hi>Arms</hi> and <hi>Matches</hi> light, to receive the <hi>priſoner</hi> comming, but when they ſaw me come in, ſome of the Officers told me they were ready to ſink down in the place where they ſtood, they expecting ſome Cavaleer or lewd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon rather, and not me (as they ſaid) to be ſo dealt with (ſome of them knowing me both in this Nation and in <hi>Ireland</hi>) and looking upon one another with amazement, ſaw it an apparent <hi>perſecution</hi> (as they ſaid) upon good men for their conſciences and the Cauſe of Chriſt: After a longer attendance; I was put into a little room, which had one little
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118847:32"/>window, and which did ſo exceſſively ſmoake, that the winde and the ſtink of a houſe of filth made it worſe than a priſon (if in that cold ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we would keep a fire) the very coales thereof being blown into the room about, but I ran to the door to eaſe my eys a little, and to take ſome ayre, thinking to have walked (a little) in the yard, but it was denyed me, the Centinels ſtanding at my doore to keep me in; yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards for very ſhame, and (perhaps) pitty, I had more liberty and the centinels were taken off, which continued till the 6th. of the third moneth enſuing.</p>
            <p>But a word or two to the Order: you may obſerve as in this, ſo in the former, and all the reſt of their Orders concerning me (that ever I could ſee) the Coppies of which are by me, there is not a tittle of any CAUSE mentioned, why they have ſo perſecuted, impriſoned and ſince baniſhed me, nor have they any colour, but what they would (I think) bluſh for ſhame to put into any of your <hi>Orders</hi> or <hi>Warrants,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> for <hi>Preaching and praying</hi>) whereby it appeares ye are impriſoned, perſecuted, plundered, baniſhed, and thus barbarouſly uſed, upon meer <hi>will,</hi> luſt, and arbitrary power, and tyranny, <hi>(ſic volo ſic jubeo)</hi> without the leaſt colour of a Law, a crime, or <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice;</hi> herein exceeding the arbitrary <hi>proceſſe</hi> of their Predeceſſors (in this <hi>practiſe</hi>) the very Prelates, Papiſts and <hi>Heathens;</hi> ſo that to this <hi>Day,</hi> (we ſee) they do not tell us the <hi>cauſe,</hi> or crime, nor can we have the liberties of Conſcience, Law, Juſtice, or Proceſſe; but yet the <hi>Lord of Righteouſneſſe ſtands by us, and is with us,</hi> for all that, <hi>&amp; laeti ſimus ſed non ſecuri; gaudentes in Domino, ſed caventes a Recidivo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Order is <hi>ſigned</hi> by <hi>H.

(for want of others) hath licked them up again; nor is this Council al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unlike the Duke of <hi>Alva's</hi> bloody Council, or the <hi>Counſel of Trouble,</hi> (in flemiſh <hi>Bloat-read</hi>) ſo called in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> as to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their proceedings, (putting down thereby the greater and the more lawful authority of the States) to perſecute, impriſon, oppreſſe, tax, levie, confiſcate, baniſh, apprehend, or put to death at the Duke of <hi>Alvas</hi> pleaſure and luſt, being meerly arbitrary and without Law, all being directed by the Duke himſelf, whoſe meaning was, that his Council ſhould be but <hi>conſultive,</hi> and not abſolute, (for that he left to himſelf alone, whereof <hi>J.

Yea in <hi>China</hi> (that Philoſophicall Government) the <hi>Choli</hi> and <hi>Zauli</hi> (men of moral principles of Philoſophy) will (at this day as is well known) admoniſh and reprove the King (or Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or) ſharply, if any thing be done contrary to the Law, and will not ſpare to do it, by publique libells, not diſſembling his faults, nor the greateſt Magiſtrates in their Nations, which they continue, to the aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of other Nations round about at their integrity and liberty, nor will they ceaſe their witneſſe one moment, till there be a return &amp; remedy; yea (as <hi>Purchas Pilg. ch.</hi> 18 <hi>lib.</hi> 4. ſaies) this every private man may do, and not ſuffer for it: But theſe in <hi>England,</hi> perſecute, plunder, baniſh and impriſon them that witneſſe againſt publique wickedneſs (&amp; that by better principles too) notwithſtanding Gods word ſaies, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.7. <hi>Thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke thy neighbour and not ſuffer ſin upon him.</hi> Wherefore in this it will be more eaſy for the Governments of <hi>Perſia, Turky</hi> and <hi>China</hi> at the laſt day than for this; and the whileſt Leproſy is the worſt, <hi>Numb.</hi> 13.2, 4.10. <hi>

            <p>Thirdly, That the juſtice of God doth ever avenge with the Sword
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:118847:40"/>upon an Apoſtate Intereſt, <hi>Levit</hi> 26.25 <hi>And I will bring the Sword upon you that ſhall avenge the quarrell of my Covenant.</hi> So <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.27. Now this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy is that which immediately preceeds the riſe of the holy Camp, or Sword (in this one ſtreet firſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.3. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.22, 25, 27.) at the end of the 42. monthes, which I take to be the outer Court, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.2. For the Lords Camp of old in the Wilderneſſe had three parts, or rather it was a threfold Camp (as the Hebrewes write) <hi>viz,</hi> 1. The Camp of Iſraell, or the 12. Tribes muſtred, <hi>Numb.</hi> 2. and ſet in their quarters under their own ſtandards (all that could bear armes) and this was the outward Camp pitched found about the Tabernacle, which was four ſquare, and ſaid to be 12. miles long and 12. broad; that is without fraction united and not eaſi y broken; this is the outer Camp which we expect to ariſe every day: The 2. Camp was the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary-Camp or of the inner-Court, Levites and Prieſts muſterd and ſet in their quarters and wards, under the charge and care of <hi>Eliazar</hi> and <hi>Ithamar, Numb.</hi> 3.4. But the inner Camp hath continued with the two Witneſſes, and with them that have gone out of the Tabernacle of the Teſtimony againſt the Beaſt all along this 42. monthes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.5, 6. The 3. Camp was called the Camp of Gods preſence, to ſave and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect his people, within the veil and in the holieſt of all, from whence came all their orders to fall on, and which firſt began to move, <hi>viz.</hi> in the ſigues of his preſence, the Cloud and pillar; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child that Sions travell will bring forth now immediatly, and begin to move us; yea the ſound of the 7. Trumpet gives the Alarm, and the 3. Woe is now at hand; only this caution love as your lives, as not to ſtay behind at the call, ſo not to ſtirr untimely leaſt you fall before your enemies, like them, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.40, 42, 44. and they be heightened againſt you; but be firſt united the inner Court and the outer. Yea theſe calld Fifth monarchy men, and Common wealth men muſt unite too, upon the principles of Righteouſneſſe to all men, (which may eaſily be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained) and then March, for the ſignes are upon us, and the Trumpets ſound, horſe, horſe and away.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Whiles our incenſe burnes within the wail, and the Piguls of our enemies (their feaſts and tears) are an abomination to the Lord, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1 And from them we are cleanſed through the water of ſeparation (made of the aſhes of the red Heiſer, <hi>i. e.</hi> Chriſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifiſe) <hi>Numb.</hi> 19. Whiles our waved-ſheafe (even of green corne and unripe) is accepted: And note from hence,</p>
            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:118847:40"/>
            <p>That it's a very <hi>ſubtil</hi> ſpecious inſinuating <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is now as worke to perſecute the Saints.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That <hi>ſeeming Brethren</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors</hi> are the <hi>Perſecutors,</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend love to us in the bloodieſt and moſt cunning deſignes againſt us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That whiles they report all over the Nation by Printing, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and every way, there is no perſecution, they perſecute us in holes and corners, (where none can ſee it but the God of heaven) not only for <hi>Conſciences,</hi> but purely for praying, preaching, and the worſhip of God, though we meddle not with the <hi>Government,</hi> or the <hi>Times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Whiles their <hi>Clergy</hi> cry out upon us, as medling with matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the <hi>Cuſhion</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <p n="5">5. For want of matter to colour over their ungodly impriſoning, Plundering, Robbing, Spoiling and Barbarous abuſing of us, they rake up the Priſons for <hi>our infirmities,</hi> and to finde matter (if they can) to make us <hi>odious,</hi> and to take away our lives, ſo they did at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> (<hi>vid.</hi> my <hi>Sutrod.</hi> of <hi>Priſon b.

One matter againſt me I remember was that the Brethren of the Church I walk with, ſent the poor deſperately <hi>wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man</hi> twenty ſhillings to relieve him (as a deed of charity) he being a ſtranger, his Family in <hi>Ireland,</hi> his pay ſhort and his want great; which charity they interpreted a deſign in me to draw him off, from their ſervice, though no ſuch thing was ever thought of or propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but this they deviſed and make it a great crime, with ſeveral other of the like coin; forcing men to affirm any thing, (as we heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) but yet the Lord hath delivered us for his great name-ſake from theſe unrighteous <hi>Judges</hi> and ſuborned <hi>Witneſſes</hi> both at <hi>Lambeth</hi> and here.</p>
            <p n="6">6. We may alſo ſee what eminent teſtimony hath been borne from heaven againſt theſe practices of theirs, for at <hi>Lambeth</hi> the great <hi>Accuſer Abdy</hi> was <hi>ſtarb'd</hi> that day he ſhould have been rewarded by them for his good ſervice, and an other one <hi>Porter</hi> ſpitting upon my head (when I was Preaching with my head out at the grates) <hi>kill'd</hi> one of their own Officers, for which he lies in the <hi>Gate-houſe,</hi> if he be not executed, and here at <hi>Winſor</hi> Mr. <hi>Wood</hi> one of our bittereſt enemies amongſt the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners,</hi> pleading much for the Governors and Soldiers in the wrongs they did us, hath not enjoyed himſelf ſince, (as it is reported) but
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:118847:41"/>was preſently after ſnach'd away by a ſuddain hand of God. <q>So the that in the way of thy judgments O Lord have we waited for thee, the deſire of out Soule is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee, and as <hi>Judges</hi> 5.31. So let all thine enemies periſh O Lord! but let them that love thee, be as the Sun when he goeth forth in his might! Amen and Amen.</q>
            </p>
            <p>My impriſonment in <hi>Winſor</hi> continued untill the <hi>Second day</hi> of the <hi>eighth Moneth</hi> 1655. by which time I had been delivered of a hopeful vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or priſon-born endeavours and diſcoveries in the worke of the day, about <hi>Generation-Truth,</hi> the <hi>two Witneſſes,</hi> the ſupputation of the times, Riſe and Ruine of the two Beaſts, order and nature of the <hi>Vials &amp;c.</hi> And preſent ſtate of great <hi>Brittany</hi> in this <hi>Grand Apoſtacy</hi> and Turn which is put out to nurſe, but being a <hi>Male-Childe</hi> is moſt miſerably threatned, and laid to be deſtroyed, if not bereft of life; but it being the fruit of faith, prayers, inward pangs, contemplations, travells of Spirit night and day, and indeed the very marrow of my priſon-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations, perhaps it may be hid of God from their bloody hands that ſeek to cut the throat of it, and I do hope ſo, for that the ſeed of a <hi>Baniſh born,</hi> is brought into the womb alſo. Upon the firſt day of the <hi>eighth Moneth</hi> in the evening a Cornet of horſe came to <hi>Winſor</hi> with Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from <hi>White-hall</hi> (or <hi>hell</hi> rather as from men but, indeed as to us from heaven!) to carry us away with him to <hi>Sandham-fort,</hi> and ſo he gave us time to prepare till the next morning, &amp; we muſt not diſpute it; my difficulty lay in the managing of this ſo ſuddain newes to my poore wife, who was very weak and in Child-bed ready to fink upon any ſuddain motion in ſo dangerus a condition as ſhe was, being but 4. days (not 5. full out) in Child bed, after ſo hard &amp; ſore a labor as gave her up (in the judgment of them about her) for a dead woman, or at leaſt the child; but that the God of prayers, yea our priſon God, the great Jehovah that appea'rd in the mount <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.22. &amp; laſt minute of need (almoſt) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond expectation ſaved both; but yet ſo as the leaſt trouble, grief, or ſuddain fright, would probably have indangered her as much, or more then before, this made me look up to him in whom I center, who give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth wiſedome and upbradeth not, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5.
